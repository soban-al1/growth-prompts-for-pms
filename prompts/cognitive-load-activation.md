# ðŸ’¬ Identify Cognitive Load in User Activation Flow

```
Act as a UX research assistant. I will paste a user onboarding script step-by-step. Your task is:

- Identify moments where cognitive load or decision fatigue may occur
- Suggest specific simplifications (wording, UI guidance, defaults)
- Propose 1 micro-interaction idea to enhance motivation per step

Assume the user is not tech-savvy and is exploring crypto investment for the first time.
