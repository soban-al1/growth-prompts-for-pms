# 🔁 Create a Retargeting Playbook Using Emotional Triggers

```
You're a behavioral psychologist + growth marketer. Create a 3-touch retargeting campaign for users who churned 30–60 days ago. Use emotional triggers from BJ Fogg’s Behavior Model:

- Touch 1: Trigger curiosity
- Touch 2: Trigger FOMO
- Touch 3: Trigger achievement and ease

Include: Copy (headline + message), channel suggestion, and psychological rationale behind each touch.
